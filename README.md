# Haml for JavaScript templates with the asset pipeline

Writing JavaScript templates for Backbone.js (or other frameworks) in your app?
Would you like to use `haml` in the asset pipeline?

This gem adds `haml` support to the Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline. You will also
need a gem that creates a compiled JavaScript template like `hogan_assets` or
`handlebars_assets` as well.

## Installing

Add this to your `Gemfile`

    gem 'haml_assets'

### Upgrading from 0.0.x

`haml_assets` now works with the `haml` gem. Please update your gemfile to only
require `haml_assets.`.

## Writing your JavaScript templates

### Templates directory

You should located your templates under `app/assets`; we suggest
`app/assets/templates`. In your JavaScript manifest file (for example
`application.js`), use `require_tree`

    //= require_tree ../templates

### The template file

Inside your templates directory, add your template file. The file should be
named as follows

    your_template_name.mustache.haml

The asset pipeline will then generate the actual JavaScript asset

1. Convert your haml to HTML
1. Compile the HTML to an mustache Javascript template using `hogan_assets`

**Important!** The asset pipeline is not invoking a controller to generate the
templates. If you are using existing view templates, you may have to edit
templates to remove some references to controller helpers.

### Helpers

All the `ActionView` and route helpers are available in your template. If you use
`form_for` and the related helpers, you should use the *new* object style, even
if you are writing an *edit* template, for example

    = form_for :contact, url: "javascript_not_working", html: {:class => :edit_contact, :method => :put} do |f|
      = f.label :name, "Name"
      = f.text_field :name, class: 'text required', autofocus: true, value: '{{name}}'

## Rendering partials

You can render partials within your views. Because this is hacked in, you can
nest your partials as normal, but they must have a recognized format such as
`html`. For example

    shared/_timestamps.html.haml

A partial will become a part of whatever template you are rendering, so make
sure that you are generating the correct markup. For example, do not include an
embedded coffeescript partial inside an embedded javascript template.
